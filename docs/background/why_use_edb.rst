Why use the ElectrolyteDB
-------------------------

The electrolyte database (EDB) provides both a command line interface for loading
chemical species and reaction data, as well as a programming interface for creating
IDAES ready configuration dictionaries.

See :ref:`How to use EDB<how_to_use_edb>` for more information on EDB.

Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

In our :ref:`How to setup simple chemistry<how_to_setup_simple_chemistry>` guide,
we demonstrated that to solve chemical reaction problems in WaterTAP a user must
provide up to 2 configuration files:

1. [Required] A **thermo-properties** configuration dictionary
2. [Optional] A **reaction-properties** configuration dictionary

Those configuration files can be generated by the user as python dictionaries
that are then fed into an IDAES unit model to define the reactions occurring
in that system. If we can create and run chemistry models in WaterTAP without
using a database, then why have the database?

As was shown in that :ref:`How to setup simple chemistry<how_to_setup_simple_chemistry>`
guide, even a simple configuration dictionary can be 100s of lines of python code and
involves numerous parameters that the user must provide. All that example did was
show how to simulate water self-ionization. Essentially a useless problem to solve.
Realistic chemistry may require dozens of hundreds of reactions and species. That is
where the EDB comes into play.
