    "* **Output metrics** can include levelized cost of water (LCOW), component cost, specific energy consumption, energy efficiency, water recovery rate, gained output ratio, and bulk temperature difference among others. \n",
    "* **Input parameters** are technology dependent, some of which include feed water salinity, membrane permeability, membrane area, pumping efficiency, thermal conductivity, operating temperature, number of stages, labor, and capital expenditure.\n",
